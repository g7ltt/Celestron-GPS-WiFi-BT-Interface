# Celestron GPS, WiFi & Bluetooth Interface

![finished board](https://github.com/g7ltt/Celestron-GPS-WiFi-BT-Interface/blob/main/Finished_WiFi_GPS_BT.png)

My take on Mark Lord's GPS/WiFi/BT interface for Celestron telescope mounts http://rtr.ca/esp32_wifi+bt+gps/

All code is credit to Mark Lord mlord@pobox.com

Board/schematic files are made with Eagle 9.x.x. PDF file of schematic contains BOM.

Some folks have noted that the ESP32-DevBoard-C as used in this project comes in 2 widths. The V2.0 board now accounts for both widths.

"For profit" production of this board is expressly forbidden.
