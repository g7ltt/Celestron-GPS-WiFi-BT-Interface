# Celestron GPS, WiFi & Bluetooth Interface

My take on Mark Lord's GPS/WiFi/BT interface for Celestron telescope mounts http://rtr.ca/esp32_wifi+bt+gps/

All code is credit to Mark Lord mlord@pobox.com

Board/schematic files are made with Eagle 9.x.x. PDF file of schematic contains BOM.

Some folks have noted that the ESP32-DevBoard-C as used in this project comes in 2 widths. The V2.0 board now accounts for both widths.

"For profit" production of this board is expressly forbidden.

Make sure that you set the voltage from the power PCB to 5.02V BEFORE you add any other PCB's. Failure to set the correct output voltage may result in undesired results and even cause failures of the other parts. Refilling the blue smoke let out by the other components is very nearly impossible for the electronics hobbyist.
